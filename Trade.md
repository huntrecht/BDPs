# Trade

## Abstract
Eventual consistency in a digital economomy a.k.a value for money

3-way model based on Quorum ... . Buyer, Supplier, Bank

In our equation, banks have a role.

## Motivation
Settlement Problem: Trade settlement today requires businesses to hold accounts
in multiple locations to handle cash and securities, splintering liquidity and
leading to a mess of post-trade pipes and buffers that kick in and delay the
settlement of the trade.

Settlement Solution: Cash held in reserve at a central bank being brought onto a
blockchain would cut through the Gordian Knot tying up each jurisdiction, making
settlement instant, removing counterparty risk and freeing up capital.

## Requirements
- Support for AfCFTA
