<p>Brokers Design Proposals (BDPs) describe standards for the Brokers digital platform, including core protocol specifications, client APIs, and contract standards.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>First review <a href="BDPs/bdp-1">BDP-1</a>. Then clone the repository and
    add your BDP to it. There is a <a
        href="https://github.com/huntrecht/BDPs/blob/master/bdp-X.md">template
        BDP here</a>. Then submit a Pull Request to Huntrecht's <a
                                                                    href="https://github.com/huntrecht/BDPs">BDPs repository</a>.</p>

<h2>BDP status terms</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Draft</strong> - an BDP that is open for consideration and is undergoing rapid iteration and changes.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Call</strong> - an BDP that is done with its initial iteration and ready for review by a wide audience.</li>
  <li><strong>Accepted</strong> - a core BDP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author. The process for Core Devs to decide whether to encode an BDP into their clients as part of a hard fork is not part of the BDP process. If such a decision is made, the BDP will move to final. </li>
  <li><strong>Final (non-Core)</strong> - an BDP that has been in Last Call for at least 2 weeks and any technical changes that were requested have been addressed by the author.</li>
  <li><strong>Final (Core)</strong> - an BDP that the Core Devs have decided to implement and release in a future hard fork or has already been released in a hard fork.</li>
</ul>

<h2>BDP Types</h2>

<p>BDPs are separated into a number of types, and each has its own list of BDPs.</p>

<h3>Standard Track ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|size}})</h3>
<p>Describes any change that affects most or all Brokers implementations or any change or addition that affects the interoperability of applications. Furthermore Standard BDPs can be broken down into the following categories.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"core"|relative_url}}">Core</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Core"|size}})</h4>
<p>Improvements requiring a core implementation.</p>

<h4><a href="{{"interface"|relative_url}}">Interface</a> ({{site.pages|where:"type","Standards Track"|where:"category","Interface"|size}})</h4>
<p>Includes improvements around client API/RPC specifications and standards.</p>
