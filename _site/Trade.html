<p>Eventual consistency in a digital economomy a.k.a value for money</p>

<p>3-way model based on Quorum â€¦ . Buyer, Supplier, Bank</p>

<p>In our equation, banks have a role.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Settlement Problem: Trade settlement today requires businesses to hold accounts
in multiple locations to handle cash and securities, splintering liquidity and
leading to a mess of post-trade pipes and buffers that kick in and delay the
settlement of the trade.</p>

<p>Settlement Solution: Cash held in reserve at a central bank being brought onto a
blockchain would cut through the Gordian Knot tying up each jurisdiction, making
settlement instant, removing counterparty risk and freeing up capital.</p>
